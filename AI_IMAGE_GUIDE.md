# Getting Actual AI-Generated Images

## The Problem
Most AI image generation APIs require authentication, API keys, or have rate limits. Free public APIs are limited.

## Solutions

### 1. Use the AI Image Downloader Script
Run: `python ai_image_downloader.py`

This script will:
- Download actual AI-generated people from ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com
- Show you Hugging Face datasets with AI images
- Generate prompts for manual AI image creation

### 2. Manual AI Image Generation

#### Free AI Image Generators:
- **DALL-E 2** (OpenAI) - Free tier available
- **Midjourney** - Free trial
- **Stable Diffusion** (Hugging Face) - Free inference API
- **Leonardo.ai** - Free tier
- **NightCafe Creator** - Free tier

#### Process:
1. Use the prompts from `ai_image_downloader.py`
2. Generate 6 images per category
3. Download and save to `images/{category}/ai/` folders
4. Use the web interface to approve/reject them

### 3. Pre-made AI Image Datasets

#### Hugging Face Datasets:
- **Fake Faces**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ashraq/fake-faces
- **AI Generated Animals**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ashraq/fake-animals
- **AI Art Collections**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/svjack/Shoji_ai_images_captioned

#### Download Process:
1. Visit the dataset page
2. Click "Files and versions"
3. Download images you want
4. Organize into category folders

### 4. Quick Start - People Category

The easiest category to get AI images for is "people":

```bash
python ai_image_downloader.py
# Choose option 1
# Enter 6 for number of images
```

This will download 6 actual AI-generated people images to `images/people/ai/`

### 5. For Other Categories

Use AI image generators with these prompts:

**Dogs**: "AI generated dog, photorealistic, high quality"
**Cats**: "AI generated cat, photorealistic, high quality"  
**Cars**: "AI generated car, photorealistic, high quality"
**Food**: "AI generated food, photorealistic, high quality"
**Nature**: "AI generated landscape, photorealistic, high quality"

And so on for each category...

## Recommended Approach

1. **Start with people**: Use the script to get 6 AI-generated people
2. **Pick 2-3 other categories**: Use DALL-E 2 or similar to generate images
3. **Use the web interface**: Approve/reject images as they're generated
4. **Gradually build up**: Add more categories over time

This way you'll have actual AI-generated images that will make your game challenging and fun!
